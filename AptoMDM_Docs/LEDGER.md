# LEDGER

Append-only log of significant changes to the AptoMDM doc set. Newest entries at the
bottom. **Never edit or remove an existing entry** — if something recorded here turns out
to be wrong, append a correction rather than rewriting history. The value of this file is
that it can be trusted as a record.

One line per change. Format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD | <who> | <what changed> | <docs propagated>
```

The last column is the accountability column: it records which referencing documents were
updated in the same pass. An entry with a blank propagation column is a flag that the
change may have left the doc set inconsistent.

2026-08-21 | Claude (agent) | Created repo scaffold: Modules/Phase_01/, Development_Docs/, QA/, UIUX/, tools/ with .gitkeep; root CLAUDE.md and .gitignore; scaffolds for Design_Roadmap, Project_Instructions, Stubs_Tracker, HOW_TO_USE, SETUP, LEDGER | None required — no existing document's content was altered. Apto_MDM_Bible_v1.2.md untouched.
2026-08-21 | Siddhant (authored) / Claude (placed) | Design Roadmap v1.2 authored content replaced the scaffold in AptoMDM_Docs/AptoMDM_Design_Roadmap.md — 16 phases, 73 modules, full 5-layer scope per module, incl. the seven v1.2 additions (3.6, 5.5, 6.4, 7.4, 11.5, 15.6, 16.5) | Consistency verified against Bible v1.2 §7: 73/73 module numbers and names match exactly, numbering contiguous, filename matches the Bible §9 reference. No Bible edit required — §7 owns design-session status, the Roadmap owns target plan. Four Bible discrepancies found and reported, NOT yet fixed: (a) §9 points at `Apto_MDM_Bible.md`, actual file is `Apto_MDM_Bible_v1.2.md`; (b) §7 marks 1.1 ✅ Complete but `AptoMDM_Module_1_1_Tenant_Organization_Setup.md` is absent from the repo; (c) v1.2 changelog says "from 59 to 73" via seven additions (59+7=66; 59 appears stale from v1.0, never updated for v1.1's Phase 4 +4); (d) changelog omits "Localization" from 6.4's title.
2026-08-21 | Claude (agent) | Authored AptoMDM_Project_Instructions.md v1.0 — the operating procedure for taking a module from roadmap entry to Bible close: document precedence table, pre-module checklist, five-layer completion bars, inherited §8.0 conventions, the seven design principles as review gates plus the agnostic test, module file standard, Definition of Done, close-out propagation checklist, amendment rule, design order incl. the 3.6/15.6/16.5 out-of-order exceptions, and review anti-patterns | Derived solely from Bible §5/§6/§8.0 and Roadmap v1.2 — no new policy introduced, no module status changed. Propagated: root CLAUDE.md §4 checklist gained the missing "Bible §8.x domain subsection" step that Bible §6's amendment rule requires, and now points at the Instructions as the long form. Four open reconciliations recorded in Instructions §14 rather than silently resolved: Phase folder naming (`Modules/Phase_01/` on disk vs `Modules/Phase 1/` in the Roadmap's Design Order Summary), Layer 4 naming (Bible mandates sample data, Roadmap's list omits it — Bible followed), the "59 to 73" count (Roadmap's own summary table records v1.1 at 66, so 66+7=73 — confirming 59 is stale from v1.0), and the still-absent Module 1.1 file.

## What belongs here

Record: new or revised module documents, Bible version bumps, phase completions, scope or
sequencing changes, reversed decisions, and stub closures.

Do not record: typo fixes, formatting passes, or work in progress. This is a log of
decisions and state changes, not an activity feed — it stays useful only if it stays
short enough to read end to end.
